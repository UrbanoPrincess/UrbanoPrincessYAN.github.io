As I entered college, I began to struggle with self-doubt. Unlike the confidence I once had while exploring the world around me, my journey in this field made me question my abilities, decisions, and even whether I was on the right path.</p> <p class="mb-6">There are many days when I find myself thinking, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot; Creativity sometimes eludes me, and I hesitate to try new things, fearing I’ll just mess them up. At times, I feel lost and unsure of whether what I&#39;m doing is right. The fear of failure can be overwhelming, causing me to avoid challenges altogether.</p> <p class="mb-6">Still, despite these hurdles, I keep pushing forward. One of my most memorable experiences as a student developer began with my first proposed project: a simple to-do list for personal use. Working alongside my friend, I realized its potential to help others, which led us to transform it into a group manager application called &quot;We Manage.&quot; Through continuous updates and collaboration, we simplified its features, making it more user-friendly and efficient.</p></div> <div class="flex-shrink-0 md:w-1/4 self-end"><img src="/images/about.jpg" alt="Princess Diane Urbano" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"/></div></div></div>';return{c(){e=d("div"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(t){e=m(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(e)!=="svelte-47lx2d"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){u(e,"class","min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-100 svelte-tznto8")},m(t,n){c(t,e,n)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&g(e)}}}class b extends o{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,f,l,{})}}export{b as component};
