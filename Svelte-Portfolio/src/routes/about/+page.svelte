          I’m Princess Diane Urbano, a 3rd-year BSIT student at Gordon College from Roosevelt, Dinalupihan, Bataan. As I entered college, I began to struggle with self-doubt. Unlike the confidence I once had while exploring the world around me, my journey in this field made me question my abilities, decisions, and even whether I was on the right path.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          There are many days when I find myself thinking, "Can I really do this?" Creativity sometimes eludes me, and I hesitate to try new things, fearing I’ll just mess them up. At times, I feel lost and unsure of whether what I'm doing is right. The fear of failure can be overwhelming, causing me to avoid challenges altogether.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Still, despite these hurdles, I keep pushing forward. One of my most memorable experiences as a student developer began with my first proposed project: a simple to-do list for personal use. Working alongside my friend, I realized its potential to help others, which led us to transform it into a group manager application called "We Manage." Through continuous updates and collaboration, we simplified its features, making it more user-friendly and efficient.
